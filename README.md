Run any of the binaries in `bin`. Each represents a different algorithm

* gbfs = Greedy, best-first search. **Looks at current piece**  
* dlbfs = Depth-limited (depth of 2) breadth-first search. **Looks at current and next peice**  
* minimax1 = Looks at current piece, next piece, and then assumes the following piece will be worst-case scenario.  
* minimax2 = Looks at current piece, next piece, and then assumes the following 2 pieces will be worst-case scenario.
